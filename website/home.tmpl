<h1>Freetron</h1>
<h2>What is this?</h2>
<p>You remember using those fill-in-the-bubble test forms for standardized
tests in school that required #2 pencils? <i>Freetron</i> is open-source
software that can grade a particular variant of these bubble forms. If you want
to use these forms in your class but don't want to buy an expensive machine to
grade them, follow the steps below.</p>

<h2>Four Simple Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Print <a href="/files/form.pdf">this form</a> (or buy it in bulk)</li>
    <li>Scan forms to PDF (e.g., black and white at 300 dpi)</li>
    <li>Create an account to upload it on this website</li>
    <li>View or export the scores</li>
</ol>
