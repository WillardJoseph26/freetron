<h2>What is this?</h2>
<p>Freetron is an open-source scantron software implementation allowing you grade
a particular variant of bubble forms. If you want forms graded, follow the

<h2>Four Simple Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Print <a href="/files/form.pdf">this form</a> (or buy it in bulk)</li>
    <li>Scan forms to PDF (e.g., black and white at 300 dpi)</li>
    <li>Create an account to upload it on this website</li>
    <li>View or export the scores</li>
</ol>
